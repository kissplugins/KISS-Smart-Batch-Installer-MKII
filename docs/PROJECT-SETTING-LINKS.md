Overview: The Core ChallengeBuilding a custom interface that links to every installed plugin's settings page is complex because WordPress has no standardized, mandatory API for registering a settings page URL. Each plugin developer can place their settings page wherever they see fitâ€”under the "Settings" menu, the "Tools" menu, a top-level menu, or even within another plugin's interface (like WooCommerce).Therefore, finding these links programmatically requires a combination of official methods, educated guessing, and parsing existing structures. No single method is 100% foolproof, but combining them will give you the highest success rate.Pattern 1: The "Settings" Link on the Plugins Page (Most Reliable)This is the most common and reliable pattern. Most well-behaved plugins add a "Settings" link directly below their name on the main wp-admin/plugins.php page.How it Works:Plugins add this link using a dynamic filter hook: plugin_action_links_{$plugin_file}. We can leverage this to our advantage. Instead of scraping the page, we can programmatically trigger this filter for each plugin and inspect the links it generates.Strategy:Get All Plugins: Use the get_plugins() function to retrieve an array of all installed plugins. You must first include the file that contains this function.if ( ! function_exists( 'get_plugins' ) ) {
    require_once ABSPATH . 'wp-admin/includes/plugin.php';
}
$all_plugins = get_plugins();
Iterate and Apply the Filter: Loop through each plugin. The key of the array returned by get_plugins() is the plugin's main file path (e.g., akismet/akismet.php), which is exactly what the filter hook needs.Find the Link: For each plugin, call apply_filters() on its unique action links hook. This will return an array of HTML <a> tags. Search this array for a link that typically contains the word "Settings."Conceptual Code:function find_all_plugin_settings_links() {
    if ( ! function_exists( 'get_plugins' ) ) {
        require_once ABSPATH . 'wp-admin/includes/plugin.php';
    }
    $all_plugins = get_plugins();
    $settings_links = [];

    foreach ( $all_plugins as $plugin_file => $plugin_data ) {
        // This filter returns an array of HTML links (e.g., 'Activate', 'Deactivate', 'Settings').
        $action_links = apply_filters( "plugin_action_links_{$plugin_file}", [], $plugin_file, $plugin_data, 'all' );

        // Now, search for the settings link within the generated HTML.
        if ( ! empty( $action_links ) ) {
            foreach ( $action_links as $link_html ) {
                // Look for a link that contains 'Settings' or has a common settings page query param.
                // This check can be made more robust (e.g., using DOMDocument to parse the href).
                if ( preg_match( '/<a\s+(?:[^>]*?\s+)?href="([^"]*)"[^>]*>.*[Ss]ettings.*<\/a>/', $link_html, $matches ) ) {
                    $settings_links[ $plugin_file ] = admin_url( $matches[1] );
                    break; // Found it, move to the next plugin.
                }
            }
        }
    }

    return $settings_links;
}
Pattern 2: Guessing Common Admin Page URLs (Fallback Method)If a plugin doesn't add a "Settings" link via the action hook, it likely has a settings page registered as a submenu item. These pages follow common URL patterns.How it Works:Admin pages are typically registered with add_menu_page() or add_submenu_page(). The resulting URL is usually one of the following:admin.php?page={menu_slug} (for top-level menus)options-general.php?page={menu_slug} (under Settings)tools.php?page={menu_slug} (under Tools)Other parent slugs like edit.php?post_type=woocommerce&page={menu_slug}The challenge is finding the {menu_slug}.Strategy:Get the Plugin Slug: The plugin's folder name is often a good guess for the menu slug. You can derive this from the plugin file path (e.g., my-plugin/my-plugin.php -> my-plugin).Construct and Test URLs: Create potential URLs based on the common patterns above.Verification (The Hard Part): You can't easily "test" if these URLs are valid without making an HTTP request or trying to find them in the global menu objects. This method is unreliable and should be used as a last resort.Pattern 3: Inspecting Global Menu Objects (Advanced & Fragile)WordPress stores the admin menu structure in global variables, primarily $menu and $submenu. You can inspect these arrays to find registered pages.How it Works:After the admin menu is built, these global arrays contain all the information about each menu item, including its title, required capability, and the URL slug.Strategy:Hook into admin_menu: Run your code on the admin_menu action hook with a late priority (e.g., 9999) to ensure all other plugins have registered their menus.Scan the $submenu Global: The $submenu array is keyed by the parent page (e.g., options-general.php). You can iterate through it to find pages.Match Against Plugin Data: Try to match the menu title or slug with the plugin's name ($plugin_data['Name']) or its text domain ($plugin_data['TextDomain']). This is still a guess, but it's more informed than the URL guessing in Pattern 2.Conceptual Code:function find_settings_pages_in_globals() {
    global $submenu;
    $found_links = [];

    // Check under the main "Settings" menu
    if ( isset( $submenu['options-general.php'] ) ) {
        foreach ( $submenu['options-general.php'] as $item ) {
            // $item[0] is the title, $item[2] is the URL slug
            $page_title = $item[0];
            $menu_slug = $item[2];
            // Here, you would add logic to match $page_title or $menu_slug
            // against a list of plugin names or text domains.
            // For example: if ( strpos( strtolower($page_title), 'my-plugin-name' ) !== false ) { ... }
        }
    }
    // Repeat for other common parent pages like 'tools.php', etc.

    return $found_links;
}
add_action( 'admin_menu', 'find_settings_pages_in_globals', 9999 );
Warning: Relying on global variables is not ideal as they are not a formal API and could change in future WordPress versions, making this pattern fragile.Recommended ImplementationFor the most robust solution, combine the patterns in order of reliability:Primary Method: Use Pattern 1 (plugin_action_links filter). This will successfully find the settings link for the majority of plugins.Secondary Method: If Pattern 1 fails for a given plugin, fall back to Pattern 3 (inspecting $submenu). Scan for menu items under options-general.php and tools.php where the menu slug or title has a high similarity to the plugin's name or folder name.Avoid: Avoid Pattern 2 (URL guessing) unless you have no other choice, as it is highly unreliable.By combining these approaches, you can build a custom plugin list that successfully links to the settings pages for most, if not all, of your installed plugins.
