# FSM Audit - Updated December 2024

## 1. Current overall project analysis state
The project is migrating toward a finite-state-machine (FSM) architecture guided by a multi-phase checklist. Phase 2 is largely complete with backend FSM centralization and processing locks implemented. The focus is now on completing frontend integration and eliminating remaining direct state checks.

## 2. Current FSM implementation status
* **State definitions.** ✅ **Complete** - Plugin states enumerated from `UNKNOWN` through `ERROR` with proper transition validation
* **Backend StateManager.** ✅ **Complete** - Validates transitions, logs events, processing locks, and broadcast queue implemented
* **Installation service.** ✅ **Complete** - `PluginInstallationService::install_plugin` now fully FSM-driven with proper state transitions
* **Frontend RepositoryFSM.** ✅ **Implemented** - TypeScript FSM with observer pattern, DOM updates, and debug logging
* **SSE infrastructure.** ✅ **Backend complete** - `sbi_state_stream` endpoint and broadcast queue working
* **Frontend SSE consumption.** ✅ **Complete** - Frontend FSM now consumes SSE stream for real-time updates
* **TypeScript builds.** ✅ **Fixed** - Removed `process.env` usage, compilation now working

## 3. Current issues with FSM implementation
* **TypeScript build failure.** ✅ **Fixed** - Removed `process.env` usage, frontend development now unblocked
* **Frontend SSE gap.** ✅ **Complete** - Frontend FSM now consumes `sbi_state_stream` endpoint with real-time updates
* **Brittle DOM coupling.** ✅ **Complete** - Replaced generated IDs with `data-repository` attributes for resilient targeting
* **Remaining direct checks.** ✅ **Complete** - Minimized `is_plugin_active()` calls, FSM-first approach implemented
* **Ad-hoc UI flags.** ✅ **Complete** - Eliminated legacy `isLoading`, `processingQueue`, `activeRequest` variables
* **Error handling.** ✅ **Enhanced** - Added error context tracking, recovery mechanisms, and retry logic

## 4. Gaps towards "bug free" / easy to maintain FSM
* Missing build dependencies block TypeScript compilation and hinder frontend FSM reliability.
* The frontend FSM is tightly coupled to specific DOM ID structures, making it sensitive to markup changes.
* Backend broadcasting lacks listeners and an SSE/long-polling endpoint, so the frontend relies on partial updates.
* Some services still query WordPress state directly, reducing the FSM’s role as single source of truth.
* Limited test coverage means transitions and event logging are not continuously validated.

## 5. Recommended next steps
### Phase 1 – Quick wins
1. ✅ **TypeScript builds fixed** - Removed `process.env` usage, compilation restored
2. ✅ **Frontend SSE integration complete** - EventSource consumption of `sbi_state_stream` implemented
3. ✅ **Ad-hoc UI flags removed** - Eliminated `isLoading`, `processingQueue`, `activeRequest` variables
4.  Decouple the FSM from the DOM by using `data-*` attributes instead of generated IDs to find and update repository rows and buttons.

### Phase 2 – Structural improvements
1.  Expose a proper event listener/queue system in `StateManager` and create an SSE or long-polling endpoint.
2.  Refactor `PluginInstallationService` so all state changes pass through `transition()`.
3.  Introduce automated tests validating allowed/blocked transitions and broadcast queues.

### Phase 3 – Refinement and maintenance
1.  Replace initial AJAX sync with real-time event stream consumption in the frontend.
2.  Document and annotate deprecated non-FSM state methods, ensuring a single state source.
3.  Expand test suite and continuous integration to prevent regression in FSM behavior.

## 6. Dependency Chain Analysis
**Critical Path:** TypeScript builds → Frontend SSE → Real-time UI updates

The frontend SSE integration **requires** working TypeScript builds first, making the build fix the highest priority item. Without TypeScript compilation, frontend development is blocked.

## 7. Progress Since Previous Audit
* ✅ **PluginInstallationService refactored** - Now fully FSM-driven with proper state transitions
* ✅ **StateManager helpers implemented** - `isInstalled()`, `isActive()`, `getInstalledPluginFile()` working
* ✅ **Processing locks working** - Prevent race conditions during plugin operations
* ✅ **SSE backend infrastructure** - Broadcast queue and streaming endpoint functional
* ✅ **TypeScript builds fixed** - Frontend development now unblocked
* ✅ **Frontend SSE integration** - Complete with real-time state synchronization
* ✅ **Ad-hoc UI flags eliminated** - FSM-based state management implemented
