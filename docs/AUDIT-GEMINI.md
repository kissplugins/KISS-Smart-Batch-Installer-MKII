ðŸŽ¯ Key Areas for Improvement for 1.0.31 - 08-28-2025

1. Eliminate Remaining Direct State Checks

The most critical remaining gap is the existence of code that queries WordPress state directly instead of consulting the FSM. This undermines the FSM's role as the single source of truth.

Action: The PROJECT-FSM.md file explicitly calls for replacing all direct calls to WordPress functions like is_plugin_active() with new StateManager methods (e.g., $this->state_manager->isActive($repo)). This is a crucial step to finalize the backend centralization.

2. Complete the Event-Driven UI

While the backend SSE infrastructure is ready, the system is not yet fully reactive. The frontend still relies on an initial AJAX sync, and the full event-driven loop needs to be completed.

Next Steps from PROJECT-FSM.md:

Implement Broadcasting: Add addListener and broadcast methods to StateManager.php so the transition() method broadcasts all state changes.

Connect Frontend: Use an EventSource in the JavaScript to listen for the state_changed events from the server.

Finalize Reactivity: Remove the initial AJAX-based state sync in favor of the real-time event stream.

3. Introduce Automated Testing

The audit file highlights that limited test coverage is a significant gap, meaning state transitions and event logging are not continuously validated.

Recommendation: As outlined in the "Structural Improvements" phase of the audit, you should introduce automated tests to validate both allowed and blocked state transitions and to ensure the broadcast and queue systems are working as expected.

4. Final Refinement and Cleanup

The final phase involves polishing the implementation to ensure long-term maintainability.

Action Items:

Deprecate Old Methods: Formally mark old, non-FSM state methods with @deprecated tags to guide future development.

Documentation: Ensure that the deprecated methods are well-documented to prevent accidental use.

Expand Test Suite: Continue to expand the test suite and integrate it into a CI/CD pipeline to prevent regressions.

In summary, the project is in a great position. By focusing on these four areas, you can transition from a "largely complete" FSM implementation to one that is robust, fully reactive, and easy to maintain.
