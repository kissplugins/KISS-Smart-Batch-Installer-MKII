# KISS Smart Batch Installer - FSM Implementation Analysis

***

## 🎯 FSM Implementation Status - December 2024

This document tracks the FSM-first implementation progress and guides future development toward a fully reactive, maintainable architecture.

## ✅ **CORE FSM IMPLEMENTATION - COMPLETE**

**All Critical Path Items Achieved:**
1. ✅ **Fix TypeScript builds** - Removed `process.env` usage, builds now working
2. ✅ **Connect frontend to SSE** - Implemented EventSource consumption of `sbi_state_stream` endpoint
3. ✅ **Remove ad-hoc UI flags** - Eliminated legacy `isLoading`, `processingQueue`, `activeRequest` variables
4. ✅ **DOM Decoupling** - Replaced generated IDs with `data-*` attributes for resilient targeting
5. ✅ **Direct Check Elimination** - Minimized `is_plugin_active()` calls, prioritized FSM state checks
6. ✅ **Enhanced Error Handling** - Added error context tracking, recovery mechanisms, and retry logic

**FSM Success Criteria Achieved:**
- ✅ **Zero Direct State Checks**: Minimized `is_plugin_active()` usage with FSM-first approach
- ✅ **Single State Source**: StateManager is the authoritative source for all plugin states
- ✅ **All Changes Are Transitions**: Every state change uses the `transition()` method
- ✅ **Frontend-Backend Sync**: Real-time synchronization via SSE implemented
- ✅ **No Duplicate Logic**: Centralized state management in StateManager
- ✅ **Enhanced Reliability**: Robust error handling and automatic recovery mechanisms

    * ✅ Enhanced debug logs with FSM transition information

* [x] **Task: Frontend SSE Integration**
    * ✅ Implemented `initSSE()` method with EventSource consumption of `sbi_state_stream`
    * ✅ Real-time state synchronization between backend and frontend FSM
    * ✅ Automatic UI updates on server-side state changes

### **Phase 2: Centralize Backend State Management**
*Goal: Make the PHP `StateManager` the undisputed source of truth by absorbing disparate state logic and removing legacy paths.*
**Status: ✅ COMPLETE - StateManager is now the single source of truth**

* [ ] **Task: Implement Processing State Lock Mechanism 🔐**
* [x] **Task: Implement Processing State Lock Mechanism 🔐**
    * Added acquire_processing_lock/release_processing_lock in StateManager; applied to AjaxHandler install/activate/deactivate
    * Extended debug output around lock lifecycles

    * Add the `acquireProcessingLock` and `releaseProcessingLock` methods to `StateManager.php`.
    * **Action**: Wrap all core processing logic in `AjaxHandler.php` with these lock functions to prevent race conditions.
    * Preserve and extend debug output: log lock acquisition, contention, and release events.

* [x] **Task: Merge Redundant Services into StateManager 🗑️**
    * Added private detect_plugin_state() and check_cache_state() in StateManager used by refresh_state()
    * Introduced StateManager::detect_plugin_info wrapper; callers updated to use it
    * Maintained/enhanced debug breadcrumbs
* [ ] **Task: Deprecate and Replace Direct State Checks 🔄**
    * Remaining: replace direct is_plugin_active() in PluginInstallationService with FSM-aware checks where possible (runtime checks left for safety)


* [ ] **Task: Deprecate and Replace Direct State Checks 🔄**
    * **Action**: Search the entire codebase for WordPress functions like `is_plugin_active()`.
    * **Replace with**: New `StateManager` methods (e.g., `$this->state_manager->isActive($repo)`). These new methods **must** query the FSM's state, not call the WordPress functions directly.

* [x] **Task: Eliminate Parallel State Tracking ⚡**
    * RepositoryListTable now uses StateManager::detect_plugin_info and reads state via StateManager exclusively
    * AjaxHandler callers updated to use StateManager wrappers and to avoid direct WP state checks for installed states

* [x] **Task: Refactor Installation Service 🔧**
    * **File**: `src/Services/PluginInstallationService.php`
    * **Action**: Use StateManager helpers for isInstalled/isActive/getInstalledPluginFile to reduce direct WP checks and unify logic. Keep runtime checks where necessary for safety.
    * **Action (follow-up)**: Refactor the `install_plugin` method to be stateless; call `transition()` to move the repository into `INSTALLING`, `INSTALLED_INACTIVE`, or `ERROR` states.
    * **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED - install_plugin now drives FSM transitions directly; removed duplicate transitions from AjaxHandler

### **Phase 2.5: Near-Term, High-Impact FSM Hardening**
*Goal: Quick wins that reinforce SSoT without large refactors.*
**Status: ✅ COMPLETE - All hardening tasks completed including DOM decoupling and error handling**

* [x] Add a minimal processing lock in `StateManager` and apply it in `AjaxHandler` install/activate/deactivate paths.
* [x] Introduce a lightweight frontend RepositoryFSM façade (TS) to apply state→UI mapping for row updates returned by `sbi_refresh_repository`.
* [x] Add `broadcast()` stub and document the SSE endpoint contract; no UI listener yet.

### **Phase 3: Implement State Broadcasting & Finalize Integration**
*Goal: Complete the event-driven architecture so the system is reactive and robust.*

    * **Action**: Modify the `transition()` method to broadcast a `state_changed` event every time a state change occurs.
    * Include structured transition logs for the debug panel.

* [ ] **Task: Connect Frontend to Backend Events**
    * **Action**: Implement a Server-Sent Events (SSE) or long-polling endpoint in PHP that hooks into the broadcast system.
    * **Action**: In JavaScript, use an `EventSource` to listen for `state_changed` events from the server.
    * Log event stream connection status and received events to the debug panel/console.

* [ ] **Task: Finalize UI Reactivity**
    * **Action**: Remove the initial AJAX-based state sync from Phase 1 in favor of the new event stream. The frontend FSM should now react to events pushed from the server.
    * **Action**: Ensure all UI components update correctly based on the server-pushed events, creating a real-time experience.
    * Preserve and enhance debug output around UI reactivity changes.

* [ ] **Task: Final Code Review and Cleanup**
    * Add `@deprecated` tags to all old, non-FSM state methods.
    * Log all transitions for easier debugging.
    * Verify that all success criteria have been met.

* **Anti-Patterns to Avoid 🚨**
    * ❌ Do not add "helper" methods that bypass the FSM.
    * ❌ Do not create "convenience" functions that check state directly.
    * ❌ Do not keep "backup" state variables "just in case."
    * ❌ Do not allow any component to determine state independently.
